  "desc": "I create digital experiences that are both visually appealing and highly functional. I’ve spent six years working as a freelance web designer across different countries, building projects from scratch and developing my skills independently. To bring my designs to life in code, I expanded into development and am now training as a full-stack developer at Technigo, focusing on JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I also continue learning through Udemy, with certificates available on my LinkedIn. I code with a strong focus on user-friendly interfaces and thoughtful UX, enjoy collaborative work, and look for opportunities to combine my design background with real-world development projects.",
